# Advent of Code 2021

Here I collected my solutions for [advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

Until the 12th, I finished them each on the same day. Afterwards, other things got in the way. I returned to the challenges months later and completed them all.

After I used Python in the [last year](https://github.com/frcroth/advent-of-code-2020), this time I used Rust exclusively, despite not having a lot of experience with that language.
